# Lesson 12 - API Testing basics. Creating E2E API tests using Postman

## This lesson covers the following topics:

1. **API testing basics**
2. **Types of testing that uses API requests**
3. **Structure of API request/response**
4. **API request methods and response status codes**

During this session we learned the basics needed to start API testing. We tried to create (simulate) E2E test using Postman tool that also uses scripts(tests) for needed requests.
Then we can run the collection (after exporting it to JSON) using [newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) cmd tool 


## How to Run collection

Import the collection to your instance of Postman using this [guide](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/)

Because we used picture upload from the local file system  - **please update /images/upload** request with the file from your file system before running request or running collection 

To run collection from Postman - Right click on this collection and select Run Collection
